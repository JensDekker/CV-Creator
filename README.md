# CV-Creator

This repo keeps track of my CV Creator project.

The idea of this program is to speed up the tailoring of resumes to job postings. There's a JSON formatted file with all the information that someone could put on a resume. Then there's a file that takes that data and puts it into a Word doc. That way there's still some manual customization to perfect it.

The files are a little messy right now since I tried to exclude my own info that I would use on my own resume. So a general testing file will be coming soon.

Also, right now I have a terminal UI to operate the program, but I'm looking into GUI libraries to help develop the program further. Specifically, I've been looking at PySimpleGUI.
